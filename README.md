# Modern RAG Application

## Overview
Industry-standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application with modern embeddings, semantic chunking, and production-ready architecture.

## Features
- Modern embedding-based document processing
- Semantic chunking with overlap preservation
- Async FastAPI architecture
- Production-grade error handling and logging
- Scalable document processing pipeline
- Advanced RAG techniques

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- 32GB RAM (optimized for CPU-only processing)
- SSD storage for vector database
- Offline-capable (all dependencies portable)

## Architecture
